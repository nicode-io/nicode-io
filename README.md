## Welcome to my new house !
> NICODE.IO

#### Hello ðŸ‘‹, 

#### I'm [Nicolas](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nicolas-denoel/), welcome to my all new life as developer !

#### After 15 years as manager and sales director it's time for me to make my dreams come true and to become a developer. Autonomous learner, problem solver and commited team member, I'm ready for challenges !

#### So feel strongly to give me any recommandation about my work, advice for future projects, and all comments you want. If you are looking to hire a strong hybrid and atypical profile in your team do not hesitate to contact me to check if we can share a project together !  

Thanks by advance for that :heart:
