> NICODE.IO

#### Hello ðŸ‘‹, 

#### I'm [Nicolas](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nicolas-denoel/), welcome to my all new life as a developer !

#### After 15 years as manager and sales director it's time for me to make my dreams come true and to become a developer. Autonomous learner, problem solver and commited team member.
#### I'm currently doing a bootcamp at Becode in order to be a junior web developer ready to take up new challenges.
#### My profile is atypical. Balanced between the logic and structure of the developer and the knowledge of the market and commercial expectations.
#### Let's no longer hesitate to share a project !
