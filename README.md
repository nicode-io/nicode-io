## Who am I

####     
#### After 15 years in the commercial sector as a manager and director, I decided to put this career on hold to devote myself fully to development.   
#### Positive spirit, with an unquenchable thirst for learning, committed and structured, I like to take up challenges and always progress by giving the best of myself.   
#### From June 2020 to Early 2021, I successfully completed the web-developer bootcamp organized by BeCode. This was followed by a first experience in a company. 
#### In March 2021, I will start a new bootcamp dedicated to .NET development with a focus on PowerBI and Sharepoint. This one will end in August 2021 with a TFE presented in front of a jury of professionals.   
#### If you have a project, no matter how big or small, don't hesitate to share it, we always have to win by doing things alongside others.     
#### If you are looking to hire a strong hybrid and atypical profile in your team do not hesitate to contact me to check if we can share a project together !
