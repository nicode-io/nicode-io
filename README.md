## :loudspeaker: Welcome !
> NICODE.IO

#### Hello 👋 , welcome to my all new life as a developer ! 

#### I'm [Nicolas](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nicolas-denoel/), a computer science enthusiast who is in the middle of his reconversion as a developer.     
#### After 15 years in the commercial sector as a manager and director, I decided to put this career on hold to devote myself fully to development.   
#### Positive spirit, with an unquenchable thirst for learning, committed and structured, I like to take up challenges and always progress by giving the best of myself.   
#### From June 2020 to Early 2021, I successfully completed the web-developer bootcamp organized by BeCode. This was followed by a first experience in a company. 
#### In March 2021, I will start a new bootcamp dedicated to .NET development with a focus on PowerBI and Sharepoint. This one will end in August 2021 with a TFE presented in front of a jury of professionals.   
#### If you have a project, no matter how big or small, don't hesitate to share it, we always have to win by doing things alongside others.     
#### If you are looking to hire a strong hybrid and atypical profile in your team do not hesitate to contact me to check if we can share a project together !  

#### See you soon!   :heart:

## 🃏 **Bonus Stage  - FLUTTER DEVELOPER**
>   January 2021 - ... 

I chose Flutter as a tool to develop my future applications on multi supports.
Given the emergence of this tool I practice it outside of my working hours, while finding a growing potential for the future


## 🕑 **Stage 2 - Internship ØPP Agency**
>   Januari 2021 - Februari 2021

[@ØPP](http://opp.mx) is a publisher of digital solutions (websites, applications, connected objects...) specialised in engagement techniques and gaming.  
I'm lucky that my first professional experience as a developer takes place in this framework which suits me so well. 
The internship was short but will remain a very interesting experience to face day-2-day developer's challenges and how an agency can build apps efficenly.


## 🕐 **Stage 1 - **BeCode** Intensive Bootcamp**
> June-December 2020 - Grade: Junior Developer

In ten months, you have a wonderful opportunity to become a great Junior App & Web Developer. 
We are motivated by inclusion and the spirit of sharing!   
The bootcamp aims at acquiring self-learning skills and mastering a junior web developer path, both frontend and backend. 
Support is provided by a team of great coaches who will guide you and help you overcome the various peaks of difficulty encountered.
[Summary of all the learning path and projects links](https://github.com/nicode-io/Becode-Learning)


## 🕛 **Stage 0 - Self-study**
> November 2019 - May 2020

My new journey began with a self-taught approach to mastering the essential basics of language and algorithmic learning.
Due to Covid, this period was extended by six months, which allowed me to be even better prepared for my Becode bootcamp.
