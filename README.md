#### Hello, welcome to my all new life as a developer ! ðŸ‘‹ 

#### I'm [Nicolas](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nicolas-denoel/), a computer science enthusiast who is in the middle of his reconversion as a developer.     
#### After 15 years in the commercial sector as a manager and director, I decided to put this career on hold to devote myself fully to development.  
#### I'm currently finishing an intensive 7 month bootcamp at Becode where I was able to acquire the superpowers of a junior developer, I am now constantly exploring the challenges that the various companies and associations active in the field can offer me.      
#### Positive spirit, with an unquenchable thirst for learning, committed and structured, I like to take up challenges and always progress by giving the best of myself.    
#### If you have a project, no matter how big or small, don't hesitate to share it, we always have to win by doing things alongside others.     

#### See you soon!

### Developer Main Steps

#### STEP 1 - Self-study - November 2019 - May 2020

My new journey began with a self-taught approach to mastering the essential basics of language and algorithmic learning.
Due to Covid, this period was extended by six months, which allowed me to be even better prepared for my Becode bootcamp.

#### STEP 2 - **BeCode** Intensive Bootcamp - June-December 2020 - Grade: Junior Developer

In ten months, you have a wonderful opportunity to become a great Junior App & Web Developer. 
We are motivated by inclusion and the spirit of sharing!   
The bootcamp aims at acquiring self-learning skills and mastering a junior web developer path, both frontend and backend. 
Support is provided by a team of great coaches who will guide you and help you overcome the various peaks of difficulty encountered.

Give maximum to get maximum :rocket:

You can find a summary of all the learning path and projects links [HERE](https://github.com/nicode-io/Becode-Learning)

#### STEP - 3-months Internship - December 2020-March 2021 

To be continued ...
